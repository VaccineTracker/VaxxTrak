# VaxxTrak
Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker

## About the Project
As COVID-19 vaccines begin to be distributed in the U.S., there is no easy way for the public to understand the full picture--How many vaccines are being distributed in my state? In my specific area? Perhaps more importantly, how many of the distributed doses are being administered? This app gives users the full picture: Vaccine distribution versus administration at the state and local levels.
